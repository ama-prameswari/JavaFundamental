## Java Fundamental

In this practices, I create a simple program using Java to introduce some basic programming concepts in the Java language. 
This program prints several fundamental features, performs variable declarations, conditional statements, and uses looping. 

**The elements introduced in this exercise include:**  
  - System.out.println: Used to print output to the console. ( The program displays the text "Hello JuaraCoding!" and "Indonesia" using System.out.println() )
  - Variable: Declares a local variable within the conditional block. ( An integer variable x with a value of 100 is declared and used in different code blocks. )
  - Conditional statement (if statement): Executes a code block if the condition is true. ( An example of an if statement with a condition that is always true (true), where        the program prints the value of the variable x and the text "True". )
  - Loop for: Prints numbers from 0 to 9 using a loop. ( The program uses a for loop to iterate 10 times, printing the value of i (the iteration counter) and the value of the      variable x in each iteration. )
