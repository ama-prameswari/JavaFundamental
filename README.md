##Exercise 1 - Java Fundamental

In this exercise, I create a simple program using Java to introduce some basic programming concepts in the Java language. 
This program prints several outputs to the screen, performs conditional statements, and uses loops. 

**The elements introduced in this program include:**  
  - System.out.println: Used to print text to the console.
  - Conditional statement if(true): Executes a block of code if the condition is true.
  - Variable: Declares a local variable within the conditional block.
  - Loop for: Prints numbers from 0 to 9 using a loop.
